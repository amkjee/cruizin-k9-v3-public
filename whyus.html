                                            Lori with Cruizin K9 is THE best! I have tried the traditional dog daycare for my girl, Jersey, but she is just so much happier to go on these hikes with Lori and a group of other dogs. She just adores Loriâ€¦. maybe more than she adores me??! Ha!
                                            <br><br>
                                            We also use their 'pit stop' service when a hike doesn't happen. I feel content while I'm at work knowing that Jersey is happy and well cared for.

We all had to adapt to our new home, and Tuck was no exception (he left behind his brother). He was super sad and it showed!  Lori was determined to make things better, and in no time, Tucky found a new tribe and now has many friends he gets to see often. 

                                                Lori is so genuine, and she truly cares about each of her "clients". Tucker definitely sees her place as his home away from home, and we're grateful to have her when we go out of town (as Tucky doesn't like to travel).
                                                
                                                Lori has been extremely accommodating and she's the first person I'd recommend for any fur baby.

                                                I would highly recommend (and have many times to friends) Cruizin K9 as one of the best animal care service providers in town.
